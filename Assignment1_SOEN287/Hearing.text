Judge: "Good morning. Let's start with the plaintiff. Please state your case."
Plaintiff: "Your Honor, I was promised a refund for the faulty product I purchased, but the company has refused to honor their commitment."
Judge: "I see. And what is the defendant's response?"

Defendant: "Your Honor, we have no record of the plaintiff's request for a refund. In fact, our policy clearly states that refunds are not given for this type of product."
Judge: "Thank you. We'll need to examine the evidence before making a ruling."
